  "description": "TGX is a tiny but full featured C++ graphics library for drawing 2D and 3D graphics onto a memory framebuffer. The library runs on any 32 bits CPU or MPU such as ESP32, Teensy, Pico (M4, M7, RP2040, RP2350...). It provides an extensive set of 2D/3D drawing primitives and aims at high quality rendering (anti-aliasing, alpha-blending, bilinear texture filtering...). The library itself is hardware-agnostic: an independent driver is required to display the image drawn in memory onto a physical screen.",
